# SATOpti
Testing some ideas to optimized the regular SAT algorithm.
The main idea, is not to test the full convex polygon against the other convex polygon 
but to first find the minimal (or close to) polygons that need to be tested.
This will have for effect to reduce the number of edge to test against each other
